## Our Products

API

This service provides the "Alphas" (Consumer/User organization) with an API which can be easily integrated with their organization's mobile application. All you have to do is turn ON the Bluetooth and you are got to go!!!! Our Exposure system service will run in the background without hampering the main purpose of the application.

Mobile Application

We have developed a mobile based application which can be easily depolyed just by using a smartphone's bluetooth. Since our service in the background, It is possible to customize the application to the organiztion's need. For example for universities- a university app, for corporates - a corporate app, which can be used for organizations internal purposes. (Seperate Service)
